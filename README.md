COVID 19'S IMPACT ON PRODUCERS AND MARKET

# Problem Description
Covid19, which has entered our lives for the last 1 year, removed us from our normal life as it entered, caused our habits to change and adversely affected all kinds of activities. This virus, which emerged suddenly in China and affected the whole world, threatens to take away the health of people all over the world, apart from damaging the economies of countries and health services. Although it shows people that health is not more important than anything, new concepts such as quarantine, old normals and prohibitions entered our lives with this virus. Unfortunately, the fact that the virus is too contagious has led countries to such solutions. Of course, although everyone says health first, even being in quarantine without financial power put people in a difficult situation. For example, we are farmers. Our only financial resource is farming. We would sow our produce, remove our harvest, and display it in the greengrocer. As a result of the serious shutdowns caused by the virus, we have not been able to bring our product to the consumer nor go out of the house for a long time. Unfortunately, the situation is the same for all manufacturers, business owners and tradesmen. In addition, our economy as a country is unfortunately not as good as other countries, and our state is not able to lend a helping hand to either the tradesmen or the producers in this painful and difficult period, as our welfare level is not as high as other countries. All purchases are destined to be supplied from the market. In addition, although tradesmen and greengrocers are allowed under certain conditions on certain days of the week, nobody has yet been able to cover their past expenses, since there has been a quarantine for a long time. Questions such as how the situation in other countries is, how long and how will this process continue in our country and how our producers and tradesmen have been affected by this process will be sought with data visualization.

# Introduction
In the developing and renewed world order, reaching everything has become much easier than before. It became possible to reach the fruits and vegetables collected in the fields during the day through greengrocers and markets. In this way, we had both fresher and healthier products as consumers. Of course, all of this was before Covid19 entered our lives. With the inclusion of Covid19 in our lives, the established orders were broken. States have initiated quarantine periods to protect the people from this disease. These processes, of course, affected the manufacturers and markets the most badly. In this process, although the states tried to support them, the fact that the grocery stores and markets were closed from time to time put both the producers financially and the consumers morally difficult. Even though the grocery stores opened from time to time, it was impossible to find fresh foods from there. From time to time, towards the end of the quarantines, we could meet with fresh food by allowing greengrocers, but this time, we are content with being taken bit by bit due to the high prices. The Covid19 process has taken over the whole world, and unfortunately, it has affected and continues to affect everyone.

# The story of problem
While the whole world was fighting Covid 19, states had to apply various measures and prohibitions. Sometimes quarantines under the name of complete closure and sometimes financial sanctions were applied. Quarantine processes disrupted most of the business sectors both in Turkey and around the world. Especially markets and greengrocers were affected by this situation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to make general evaluations about the situation of manufacturers and markets affected by the Covid 19 period. In this case, the story of the problem is shaped around 2 main topics. This is the general situation of the markets and agriculture in the world and employment and unemployment situation in U.S  the post-quarantine effects. Thus, some relevant analyzes and visual data will be made to support the story, such as the effects of Covid19 on manufacturers and markets, the situations during and after the quarantine process.
