**COVID 19'S IMPACT ON PRODUCERS AND MARKET

# **Problem Description
  **Covid19, which has entered our lives for the last 1 year, removed us from our normal life as it entered, caused our habits to change and adversely affected all kinds of activities. This virus, which emerged suddenly in China and affected the whole world, threatens to take away the health of people all over the world, apart from damaging the economies of countries and health services. Although it shows people that health is not more important than anything, new concepts such as quarantine, old normals and prohibitions entered our lives with this virus. Unfortunately, the fact that the virus is too contagious has led countries to such solutions. Of course, although everyone says health first, even being in quarantine without financial power put people in a difficult situation. For example, we are farmers. Our only financial resource is farming. We would sow our produce, remove our harvest, and display it in the greengrocer. As a result of the serious shutdowns caused by the virus, we have not been able to bring our product to the consumer nor go out of the house for a long time. Unfortunately, the situation is the same for all manufacturers, business owners and tradesmen. In addition, our economy as a country is unfortunately not as good as other countries, and our state is not able to lend a helping hand to either the tradesmen or the producers in this painful and difficult period, as our welfare level is not as high as other countries. All purchases are destined to be supplied from the market. In addition, although tradesmen and greengrocers are allowed under certain conditions on certain days of the week, nobody has yet been able to cover their past expenses, since there has been a quarantine for a long time. Questions such as how the situation in other countries is, how long and how will this process continue in our country and how our producers and tradesmen have been affected by this process will be sought with data visualization.

# **Introduction
  **In the developing and renewed world order, reaching everything has become much easier than before. It became possible to reach the fruits and vegetables collected in the fields during the day through greengrocers and markets. In this way, we had both fresher and healthier products as consumers. Of course, all of this was before Covid19 entered our lives. With the inclusion of Covid19 in our lives, the established orders were broken. States have initiated quarantine periods to protect the people from this disease. These processes, of course, affected the manufacturers and markets the most badly. In this process, although the states tried to support them, the fact that the grocery stores and markets were closed from time to time put both the producers financially and the consumers morally difficult. Even though the grocery stores opened from time to time, it was impossible to find fresh foods from there. From time to time, towards the end of the quarantines, we could meet with fresh food by allowing greengrocers, but this time, we are content with being taken bit by bit due to the high prices. The Covid19 process has taken over the whole world, and unfortunately, it has affected and continues to affect everyone.

# **The story of problem
  **While the whole world was fighting Covid 19, states had to apply various measures and prohibitions. Sometimes quarantines under the name of complete closure and sometimes financial sanctions were applied. Quarantine processes disrupted most of the business sectors both in Turkey and around the world. Especially markets and greengrocers were affected by this situation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to make general evaluations about the situation of manufacturers and markets affected by the Covid 19 period. In this case, the story of the problem is shaped around 2 main topics. This is the general situation of the markets and agriculture in the world and employment and unemployment situation in U.S  the post-quarantine effects. Thus, some relevant analyzes and visual data will be made to support the story, such as the effects of Covid19 on manufacturers and markets, the situations during and after the quarantine process.

# Visualization Tools
**I used the Datawrapper application to visualize the data I collected in my project.

# Data Gathering
  **I collected Covid-19 effects on agriculture and market data for data visualization. I visualized this data with the datawrapper application. I have reached the Covid-19 effects on agriculture and market data for  from the addresses below.


- **I followed the pandemic process in the world and the food prices in this process on this site and accessed the data from this site. In addition, we can see the nominal and real indices of food during the pandemic process from the link I mentioned below and we can see how this pandemic process affects inflation and purchasing power.

- **I was able to observe the harms of Covid19 in general on this site. I was able to look and see which industry was affected by how much.

- **I have followed the pricing of the producers in the industrial and domestic markets from the site below and got some information from here.

- **On the other hand , I found the unemployment rates and job rates of the U.S from the website below and added them. This is how we can see how the pandemic process affects unemployment rates.

- **Also, i collected other data sets and created its tables. It is in the data file of my repository. I use these reliable sources as follows.

# **The Challenges Of Data Gathering

  **My first aim of doing this study was to research and consider the positive and negative effects on markets and greengrocers instead of pandemic and quarantine processes. But while doing research, I noticed. Yes, there are some news, but I had difficulty finding research academically. Obviously, when we look at the world dimension of the business, it was not easy to find, but at least it was easier than in Turkey. Finding data was again difficult. But I was able to access some data with the help of known and trusted news agencies as much as I could. Thanks to this, I completed my research. I examined the data sets I found and made the necessary arrangements. Later, I visualized these data sets and added them to the system.
